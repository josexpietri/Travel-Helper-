The three files—UserTerm.java, CALL.java, and apiHandler.java—form a small system designed to find and present top-rated businesses (such as restaurants, hotels, parks, or bars) to the user based on their location and preferences. UserTerm.java defines a UserTerm class, which serves as a data model for a single business listing. Call.java acts as the main driver. The apiHandler class manages all the technical details of connecting to external APIs.
